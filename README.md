# Wrangle-And-Analyze-Data
The 3rd core project in Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

## Project Overview

This project aims to challenge what was learned in the **Data Wrangling** chapter. It's based on wrangling Twitter data from an account named "WeRateDogs". The outcome is creating interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualization. 

Udacity's Introduction:

> The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.


The project should follow these 6 steps:
1. Gathering data
2. Assessing data
3. Cleaning data
4. Storing data
5. Analyzing and visualizing data
6. Reporting the wrangling efforts and the analyses (and visualizations)

## Gathering Data
I was required to collect data from 3 different sources, and resulting in 3 different file types. Each of these must be imported into a seperate pandas DataFrame at first.

Sources collected:
1. WeRateDogs Twitter archive
  File was provided by Udacity.
  
2. Tweet image predictions
  Using the Requests Library to request it from a given link.

3. Twitter API
  Using `Tweepy` and the IDs from the twitter archive gathering every tweet's retweet and favorite count was possible.
  
File types (respective to the sources):
1. csv
2. tsv
3. txt
